Todo
- Check if I can use Blizzard's callback system instead of my own, because why not
- Check if things in Data.lua can be improved
- Probably remove quest log counter
- Something up with LFG
- Something up with my bountyboard
- Anchoring system with full screen and flight map
- Look into new ItemQuality colors stuff
- Look at old dropdown features
    - FilterButton indicator for official filtering
    - Used to disable filter linked to official filter (disbale, tooltip with info, matching icon in name instead?)
    - Used to disabled with settings or what's new open. Probaly just hide them with some layout changes
- Update settings UI
- Update What's New UI
- Fix map pins lingering until quests are done loading when switching map
- Figure out War Within data and testing, preferably without buying the expansion :|
- Probably no longer bother with WorldQuestTab Utilities
- Check support for external addons, maybe
- Figure out what else needs to be on this list
- Determine feasibility of continued support

- Maybe change quest design with faction as sort of fade on the left

Done
- General compatibility with 11.1
- Integrate in new Worldmap tab structure 
- Improved expansion zones in data a bit
- Curse at C_Map.GetMapChildrenInfo for not being perfect... Like why doesn't it include Dalaran in the Broken Shores
- Error with combat block overlay
- Colorpicker used in the settings is kaput
- Figure out error in filter dropdown -> Check new dropdown system
- Look at moving from HybridScrollFrame to new systems
- Update visuals to match the new UI
- Improve Dataprovider 
- Weird sort behaviours
    - Faction sorting with bonus quests puts no-faction bonus at top
    - Tpye sort mixes bonus with actualy WQ
