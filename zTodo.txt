If you're reading this; temper your hopes and expectations

Todo
- Look at moving from HybridScrollFrame to new systems
- Update visuals to match the new UI
- Figure out error in filter dropdown -> Check new dropdown system
- Error with combat block overlay
- Improve Dataprovider 
- Check if I can use Blizzard's dataprovider instead of my own, because why not
- Check if things in Data.lua can be improved
- Probably remove quest log counter
- Something up with LFG
- Anchoring system with full screen and flight map
- Figure out War Within data and testing, preferably without buying the expansion :|
- Probably no longer bother with WorldQuestTab Utilities
- Check support for external addons, maybe
- Figure out what else needs to be on this list
- Determine feasibility of continued support

Done
- General compatibility with 11.1
- Integrate in new Worldmap tab structure 
- Improved expansion zones in data a bit
- Curse at C_Map.GetMapChildrenInfo for not being perfect... Like why doesn't it include Dalaran in the Broken Shores
